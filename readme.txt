Keep your visitors busy & saves your time by automatically inter linking your articles.

== Description ==

Post Linker is a simple plugin which interlinks all of your posts automatically. This keeps your visitors busy reading articles and will definitely increase "Time on site" & maybe your advertisement or affiliate money.
You may be using a section like "You might also like these" into which you must be linking your other relevant posts manually. Post Linker automates your work so that you don't have to worry about recommended articles.

Post Linker automatically generates "You might also like" or "Recommended articles for you" or "Must read articles" section for you, which you can insert in between any of your posts. Some of its features are:

*	Automatically insert "You might also like" section inside any article
*	Takes care of display the most relevant links inside the section
*	Display the section wherever you want inside an article
*	Once links generated the headings, the article links and the sequence get fixed, its indexing friendly (I guess)
*	Article would just seem that links are inserted manually not dynamically by a plugin
*	You can store different default headings which will be used on all the posts
*	Deactivation disappears the shortcode from every posts
*	Many cool new features coming soon :)

Just give it a try you won't regret it. I know you'll definitely love it. Post Linker save your time which can be utilized in other productive work like visiting PluginsTalk.com at http://pluginstalk.com , etc.
